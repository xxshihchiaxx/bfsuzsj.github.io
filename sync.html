                <p>Automatically upload your documents to Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive for safekeeping while you're working in GoodNotes. Auto-backup is best used with iCloud sync to protect your notes so that you can always find them in the auto-backup folder in case something destructive occurs to your local library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Auto-backup is a one-way process, and so it doesn't sync your changes across your devices as iCloud does. Changes you make in the cloud storage won't affect your GoodNotes library.
                </p>

                <h4>How to set it up</h4>
                <p>
                    1. Tap the ⚙️ icon in the top-right corner of the Library view > Settings > Automatic Backup, and enable Auto Backup.<br>
                    2. Choose a cloud storage and sign in to it.<br>
                    3. Change other auto-backup settings if needed, and tap Done.
                </p>
                <p>Once you've enabled the feature for the first time, please keep the app visible on the screen until auto-backup finishes uploading your entire library. After that, only changed documents get backed up. You can see the auto-backup status by tapping the small icon under the "Documents" heading.

                <h3><a id="q2">Backing up and restoring data manually in GoodNotes 5
                </a></h3>
                <p>You can create a backup file of your entire library by tapping the ⚙️ icon in the top-right corner of the Library view > Settings > Backup Data.
                </p>
                <h4>Where is this backup saved?
                </h4>
                <p>When the backup process is done, the Share Sheet will show up and you can select a destination or any app to save the backup file (in .zip) to either iTunes, iCloud, a supported cloud storage through the Files app, an external app, and so on.<br>
                Please note that GoodNotes needs to stay open in the foreground to finish the backup process.<br>
                If you close the app, the backup process has to be restarted.
                </p>
                <h4>How to restore your backup
                </h4>
                <p>You can restore your backup file back to GoodNotes library simply by importing that .zip file.

                <h3><a id="q3">Syncing GoodNotes documents between iPhones/iPads/Macs</a></h3>
                <p>Synchronizing GoodNotes documents between GoodNotes 5 on your iOS devices on Mac requires iCloud. When your device has an active internet connection, your changes will sync across all devices that are logged into the same Apple ID.<br>
                To set up iCloud sync for GoodNotes, please do the following on all your devices:<br>
                1. Sign into the same Apple ID.<br>
                2. Open the Settings app on your iOS / iPadOS devices, go to Apple ID > iCloud, and make sure both "iCloud Drive" and "GoodNotes" are enabled.<br>
                3. Open System Preferences on your Mac, go to iCloud, enable "iCloud Drive". Click on Options... next to "iCloud Drive" and also enable "GoodNotes" in the list.<br>
                4. Open GoodNotes, tap the Gear icon in the top-right corner of the Library view > Settings > iCloud Settings and enable "Use iCloud."
